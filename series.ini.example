# duplicate sections for each series

[Series name here]
# pattern of the name of the file to download
# the pattern helps to select the right anime from the right team,
# make it as precise as you can (usually, using the file name entirely is fine)
# you can tell the place of the episode number with {number}
# if the file has unpredictible parts for each episode, you can tell such
# places with {garbage}
# {number} and {garbage} are converted to "*" when querrying NyaaTorrent
#
# examples:
# file_pattern = [BakedFish] Anne Happyâ™ª - {number} [720p][AAC].mp4
# file_pattern = [DameDesuYo] Koutetsujou no Kabaneri - {number} (1280x720 10bit AAC) [{garbage}].mkv
